              <p>Louis has spent his career at the intersection of education, product, and industrial systems — starting as a secondary school teacher, then moving into product leadership and founding teams. Most recently, he led product at a simulation and training company building software used in safety-critical environments across heavy industry and infrastructure.</p>

              <p>Jonty is a hands-on technical builder with experience delivering complex systems for training, assessment, and operational workflows. He has worked across engineering and product roles, shipping real software used by professionals in regulated, real-world contexts.</p>

            <li>Built training and assessment platforms used in classrooms and industrial settings</li>
            <li>Led and coordinated multi-disciplinary technical teams</li>
            <li>Shipped software where procedure adherence, evidence, and correctness matter</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We're now applying those lessons to a harder problem: helping engineers complete physical work faster, with fewer mistakes, and without the overhead of manual supervision or paperwork.</p>
          <p>Coefficient exists because we've seen first-hand how much time is lost between "doing the work" and "proving the work was done correctly" — and we believe AI can close that gap.</p>
